Prisoners-Dilemma
=================

This is just a little simulation we're putting together for fun. We're just simulating the classic Prisoner's Dilemma problem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma), trying out different strategeies and seeing which are the best and most interesting. Of course, we're always interested in adding more game modes or more complex versions of this game. Feel free to contribute anything you want, especially new prisoners, or to work on any of the issues we've got up.
